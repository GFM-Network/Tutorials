### Method 3: Manual Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository into a new folder (let's call it `<repository_name>`).

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Move Contents:**
   - Move the contents of the cloned repository to the existing folder.

    ```bash
    mv <repository_name>/* <existing_folder_name>/
    ```

3. **Remove Extra Folder:**
   - Remove the now-empty folder created during the cloning process.

    ```bash
    rmdir <repository_name>
    ```

Choose the method that best fits your workflow. The key is to either clone without creating a new subfolder or to handle the renaming and moving of folders manually.
