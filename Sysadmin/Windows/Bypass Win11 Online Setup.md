## Skip OOBE Internet Check in Windows Setup

If you reach a screen where an internet connection is required during Windows Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), you can skip this step using the following method:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - When you reach the internet connection screen, press `Shift` + `F10` to open Command Prompt.

2. **Enter Bypass Command**:
   - In the Command Prompt window, type the following command:
     ```
     OOBE\BYPASSNRO
     ```
   - Press `Enter` to execute the command.

3. **Restart the Process**:
   - After entering the command, the setup process will restart.
   - This time, you will see an option that says “I don't have an internet access”.

4. **Continue Without Internet Setup**:
   - Click on the “I don't have an internet access” button to skip the internet setup requirement.

Now you can proceed with the Windows setup without needing an internet connection during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) phase.
